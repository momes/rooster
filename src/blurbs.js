Television sells tunnel vision//I knew I was acting in something


Lately I lack tooth
You can skip the sidebar with me



Maybe i'll hit the road or maybe I will sidewalk it

I should have called my mom back, I miss the back of the car



How are you? She said. I'm getting older


I feel I should slow down BUT YOU'RE THE ROCKET MAN

Another weight in your shoe//Another string 'round your shoe

I'm just happy that I am able to be the last one at your table. How can you believe in me?
